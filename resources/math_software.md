# Math software libraries ( dependencies )

## Literature

There exists a large amount of literature on the topic of math software programs ( See this [link](https://www.google.com/search?q=handbook+mathematical+software&oq=handbook+mathematical+software&aqs=chrome..69i57j46l4j69i61l3.4384j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) and this [link](https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?start=10&q=handbook+mathematical+software&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1) ).
